/**
 * Created by mwu on 2020/4/2
 * <p>
 * ExecutorService使用线程池中的线程执行提交任务
 * 线程池可以通过Executors创建
 * <p>
 * 线程池解决2个问题
 * 1.通过线程复用的方式，减少任务间调度开销，提高大量任务时的执行性能
 * 2.提供管理和消费线程的方式，维护数据统计，如已完成的任务数
 * <p>
 * Executors为常用场景定义了线程池的初始化方式
 * Executors#newCachedThreadPool 无界的线程池，并且可以自动回收；
 * Executors#newFixedThreadPool 固定大小线程池；
 * Executors#newSingleThreadExecutor 单个线程的线程池；
 * <p>
 * 线程池提供可扩展的参数设置
 * 1.corePoolSize：核心线程数
 * 2.maximumPoolSize：最大线程数
 * <p>
 * 默认情况下
 * core threads是在提交任务时创建的
 * 但是可以通过方法提交创建
 * prestartCoreThread和prestartAllCoreThreads
 * 分别启动一个和全部核心线程
 * <p>
 * ThreadFactory默认创建线程优先级为NORM_PRIORITY
 * 默认非守护线程
 * <p>
 * allowCoreThreadTimeOut和keepAliveTime
 * 如果allowCoreThreadTimeOut=true
 * 则当核心线程空闲时间超过keepAliveTime时，也会超时回收
 * <p>
 * 队列选择
 * SynchronousQueue：无界队列，无容量，无缓冲等待队列，不存储元素
 * LinkedBlockingQueue：无界队列，未消费的任务在队列中等待
 * ArrayBlockingQueue：有界队列，防止资源耗尽
 * <p>
 * 指定拒绝策略RejectedExecutionHandler
 * ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy：RejectedExecutionException异常
 * ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy：该策略默默的丢弃无法处理的任务，不予任何处理
 * ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy：只要线程池未关闭，该策略直接在调用者线程中，运行当前的被丢弃的任务
 * ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy：该策略将丢弃最老的一个请求，也就是即将被执行的任务，并尝试再次提交当前任务
 * <p>
 * 钩子函数
 * 1.beforeExecute，afterExecute
 * 2.terminated
 *

     * ctl
     * 线程池状态控制字段，由两部分组成
     * 1.workerCount：wc工作线程数，最大(2^29)-1，大概 5 亿个线程
     * 2.runState：rs线程池的状态，枚举如下
     * ----RUNNING（-536870912）：正常运行中，接受新任务、处理队列中的任务
     * ----SHUTDOWN（0）：不接受新任务，但仍在处理已经在队列里面的任务
     * ----STOP（536870912）：不接受新任务，也不处理队列中的任务，对正在执行的任务进行中断。
     * ----TIDYING（1073741824）：所有任务都被中断，workerCount=0，整理状态
     * ----TERMINATED（1610612736）：terminated()已经完成的时候
     * <p>
     * 3.runState状态转换
     * ----RUNNING -> SHUTDOWN：调用 shudown(),finalize()
     * ----(RUNNING or SHUTDOWN) -> STOP：调用shutdownNow()
     * ----SHUTDOWN -> TIDYING -> workerCount==0
     * ----STOP -> TIDYING -> workerCount==0
     * ----TIDYING -> TERMINATED -> terminated()执行完成之后

     * 1. We may start out with an initial task, in which case we
     * don't need to get the first one. Otherwise, as long as pool is
     * running, we get tasks from getTask. If it returns null then the
     * worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration
     * parameters.  Other exits result from exception throws in
     * external code, in which case completedAbruptly holds, which
     * usually leads processWorkerExit to replace this thread.
     * <p>
     * 2. Before running any task, the lock is acquired to prevent
     * other pool interrupts while the task is executing, and then we
     * ensure that unless pool is stopping, this thread does not have
     * its interrupt set.
     * <p>
     * 3. Each task run is preceded by a call to beforeExecute, which
     * might throw an exception, in which case we cause thread to die
     * (breaking loop with completedAbruptly true) without processing
     * the task.
     * <p>
     * 4. Assuming beforeExecute completes normally, we run the task,
     * gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to afterExecute.
     * We separately handle RuntimeException, Error (both of which the
     * specs guarantee that we trap) and arbitrary Throwables.
     * Because we cannot rethrow Throwables within Runnable.run, we
     * wrap them within Errors on the way out (to the thread's
     * UncaughtExceptionHandler).  Any thrown exception also
     * conservatively causes thread to die.
     * <p>
     * 5. After task.run completes, we call afterExecute, which may
     * also throw an exception, which will also cause thread to
     * die. According to JLS Sec 14.20, this exception is the one that
     * will be in effect even if task.run throws.
     * <p>
     * The net effect of the exception mechanics is that afterExecute
     * and the thread's UncaughtExceptionHandler have as accurate
     * information as we can provide about any problems encountered by
     * user code.

         * 判断是否需要添加一个线程（可能上次检查后，已有的线程已经停止）

         * thread.  If it fails, we know we are shut down or saturated
         * and so reject the task.
